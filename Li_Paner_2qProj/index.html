			<h1>LGBTQ+ Advocacy</h1>
			<p>This advocacy aims to help the members of the LGBTQ+ community have a place in this world. Even today, a lot of members of the community get discriminated for being who they are. Our advocacy wants to make this world safe for people in the community by fighting for equal rights and liberties.</p>

			<h1>Our Rights</h1>
			<p>The LGBTQ+ Community has pushed to the forefront of their fight for equal rights. LGBT individuals are fighting for their civil rights in Congress, courts, and public spaces. Although LGBT people have become more accepted in our new society, they still experience actual discrimination in every aspect of life, which is why our advocacy aims to help fight for our rights. (ACLU, n.d.)</p>

			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>For centuries, people in the LGBTQ+ community have faced discrimination from the church, the state, medical authorities, and fellow citizens. For a long time, governments imposed public and dramatic punishments for engaging in homosexual activity or shifting from set gender roles, resulting in people growing scared of being involved with community at all, and internalizing homophobia. While enforcing homophobia for generations, these avenues of punishment also made societies aware of the discrimination the community had and still has to face.</p>
			<p>Before the scientific and political revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, there were few organizations or resources available to those who dared to speak out for tolerance and change or who realized they, too, had this identity and were in danger. As a result, over time, social movements centered around fighting for equality for the LGBTQ+ community arose as a response to these prejudices and to support others who were struggling (Morris, 2009).</p>
