			<h1>How to Help</h1>
			<p>You can help our advocacy by sharing our mission with other people or just being an ally! Being there to lend a helping hand or ear to people in the community will help a lot, especially since most people in the community are closeted and afraid of being hurt. It may not sound like much, but just being there to listen helps a lot already. </p>

			<h1>Why this advocacy?</h1>
			<p>All across the world, there are people right now who are internally and sometimes physically suffering just for loving who they want to love. There are children who are ostracized and abused by their parents for showing their true colors and for telling their parents who they really want to be. By supporting our advocacy, you're helping create a safe space for these people, and helping create an equal and righteous world for everyone. 
			</p>
			<p>The LGBTQ+ community has been suffering discrimination for too long, and we need to work together to make a world that's safe for everyone.
